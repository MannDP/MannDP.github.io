My Name: 
Hi! My name is Mann. I'm an electrical engineering undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo currently in my first year, and an aspiring software developer. I was born in India, but have lived in Canada for most of my life. I'm interested in computer science, web development, basketball, and photo/video editing. 

My Name: Hi! This is my website, and a place (I hope) you've come to learn a little more about me. I'm currently an undergraduate student enrolled in Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and an aspiring software developer. I'm interested in everything CS: frontend, backend, fullstack, machine learning, AI. I love learning new things, and finding innovative solutions to problems. I'm a basketball fan, a self-described perfectionist (who learns from his mistakes), and enjoy meeting new people and working in a team capacity. I've been said to be snarky with a sarcastic sense of humor, and I'd love to meet and work with you if given the opportunity.
