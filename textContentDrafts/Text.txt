My Name: 
HomePage
Hi! This is my website, and a place (I hope) you've come to learn a little more about me. I'm currently an undergraduate student enrolled in Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and an aspiring software developer. I'm interested in everything CS: Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack, Machine Learning, AI. I love learning new things, and finding innovative solutions to problems. I'm a basketball fan, a self-described perfectionist (who learns from his mistakes), and enjoy meeting new people and working in a team capacity. I've been said to be snarky with a sarcastic sense of humor, and an unrelenting work ethic. I'd love to meet and work with you if given the opportunity.
